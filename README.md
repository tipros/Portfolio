The objective of this project is to explore the data of over 319,000 crime incidents. Bar graphs are generated to identify the top 10 offenses, number of crimes per year, number of crimes by day of the week, and number of crimes by hour of the day. Heat maps were created to visualize the number of crimes by hour and by day of the week, and to identify which districts had the most crime by year.
