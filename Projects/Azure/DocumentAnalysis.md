# Using Pre-Built Models to Analyze Documents
In this project, a pre-build model is selected to analyze documents.

## Create Resources
To complete this exercise, a new resource Document Intelligence is required to be created from https://portal.azure.com

## Call the Resources
To test  the sample code is cloned from GitHub at https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-document-intelligence from VS Code
and the code is in the folder Labfiles/01-prebuild-models/Python. 
</br></br>
The updated Python code can be found at https://github.com/tipros/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Azure/Code/document-analysis.py
</br>
The endpoint URL and API key needs to be udpated inside the file directly. The following document is analyzed.
