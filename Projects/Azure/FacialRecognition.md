# Facial Recognition

There are two Azure AI services that you can use to build solutions that detect faces or people in images: Azure AI Vision and Face service.
</br>
</br>
The Azure AI Vision service enables you to detect people in an image, as well as returning a bounding box for its location.

The Face service provides comprehensive facial detection, analysis, and recognition capabilities.

Code to test the 2 services is cloned from the lab 4 from https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision
