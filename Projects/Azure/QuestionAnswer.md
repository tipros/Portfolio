# Question and Answering with Azure AI Language

Azure AI Language includes a question answering capability, 
to define a knowledge base of question and answer pairs 
that can be queried using natural language input. 
The knowledge base can be published to a REST endpoint 
and consumed by client applications such as bots.
</br></br>

The knowledge base can be created from existing sources, including:
Web sites containing frequently asked question (FAQ) documentation.
Files containing structured text, such as brochures or user guides.
